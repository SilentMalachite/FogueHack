# Style and Conventions

- Language: TypeScript with `strict: true`
- Frontend: React function components, hooks, Zustand stores, Tailwind utility classes
- Naming: PascalCase for components/types, camelCase for functions/variables, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (per CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Paths/Aliases: `@/*` -> `client/src/*`, `@shared/*` -> `shared/*` (vite/tsconfig)
- Tests: No conventional runner configured; browser test console at `/test-console.html`
- Lint/Format: README mentions ESLint/Prettier, but no config or scripts exist in repo
